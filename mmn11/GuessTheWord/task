Write an application that implements the game.
The computer chooses a random word from a word pool and displays a series of lines the length of the word
Every line represents one letter.
The user tries to guess the word by choosing one letter from the alphabet in each turn.
If the letter appears in the word, it will be displayed in its appropriate place in the series of lines. 
If the letter appears in more than one place, it will be displayed in all the places where it appears.
The user continues to guess letter by letter until he guesses the whole word.
Finally, the user must be presented with the number of guesses and be allowed to start a new game.

The user interface will be implemented using standard input and output that includes the following elements:
- The guessed word (initially represented as a series of lines)
- A string representing the letters of the alphabet that have not yet been selected
- The user enters the selected letter (from the letters that have not yet been selected)
- In case the user enters an invalid input, the program will display an appropriate message
