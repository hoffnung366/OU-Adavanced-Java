Write a JavaFX application that displays a drawing consisting of ten shapes with random properties as follows:
- the shapes will be of type squares, ellipses and lines
- their color will be determined randomly
- the size of the shapes in pixels will be limited so that the width (and height) of their bounding rectangle is less than a quarter of the width (and height) of the drawing surface
- the position of the shapes will be randomly determined according to the width and height of the drawing surface
- there is no need to ensure that the shapes appear in their entirety within the drawing area
- there is no need to prevent shapes from hiding each other
