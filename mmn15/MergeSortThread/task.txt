Write a system that performs a parallel sort-merge of an array of integers of length n
The sort-merge algorithm will be performed as follows:
- The array will be divided into n arrays with a single element that will be allocated to a common pool
- The system will create m merging processes that will run in parallel. |
  Each process will remove two arrays from the database, merge them and return to the database one array that is the merger of the two arrays
- The merging processes will continue to merge pairs of arrays until all the arrays are merged in the buffer
  A single array will remain which is the sorted array.
- Finally, the sorted array must be displayed
- The user must be allowed to provide values for n and m (the number of array members and the number of processes).
  The elements of the array will be random numbers in the range 1..100)
