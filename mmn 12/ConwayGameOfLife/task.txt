Write an application that performs a simulation for the game of life on a 50*50 matrix as follows:
The program will display the life matrix in the window on which the sites must be drawn as empty and filled squares according to the life states. Do the drawing on a Canvas element located inside an Application window
The window will include a button that allows the user to move to the next generation. In response to the first click of the button, the matrix will be initialized with rhodomal values and displayed on the drawing surface. As a response to additional button presses, the class will calculate the life states of the next generation and update the display.
Note that you must re-introduce the entire matrix each time you move to the next generation

The Game of Life is a simulation game developed by the mathematician John Conway as a study model of the life cycle of the living organism.
The game is played on a huge matrix whose parts are possible life sites: 
each site can have one of the following two situations:
A. "There is a life" - a full life website - will be marked as a full square
B. "There is no life" - an empty life site - mark as an empty square

CONWAY'S BASIC LAWS OF GENETICS
Birth - in every site where there is "no life" that has exactly 3 such lives, there will be a birth in the next generation. Otherwise the site remains "lifeless" - empty.
Death - at any site where there is "life" that has 0 or 1 living neighbors, death will occur in the next generation as a result of loneliness. In any site where "there is life" even if there are 4 or more lives, death will occur in the next generation as a result of "population explosion"
Existence - any site where "there is life" and has 2 or 3 living entities, will continue to exist in the next generation.
The processes of birth, death and existence occur simultaneously in all sites and create a new state of life called a new generation.
